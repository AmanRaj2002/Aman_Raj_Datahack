1. First imported the required classes and modules

2. Then stored the given data appropriately

3. Segregarted the data into numerical and categorical columns

4. Used features like PipeLine and ColumnTransformer

5. Done some Feature Engineering: filled missing values using SimpleImputer, 
                               scaled the values using RobustScaler
                               
6. each for numerical as well as categorical columns and applied it to the training and test data

7. used another PipeLine for implementing Logistic Regression

8. used function predict_proba to find out the probabilities each for xyz_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine

9. combined them into a data frame and converted it into a csv file.
